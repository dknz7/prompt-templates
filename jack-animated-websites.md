## 1) Start Frame — Hero Product Image Prompt

**[PROJECT NAME] – First Frame Product Image**

Create a high-quality product image using the uploaded photo of **[PRODUCT NAME]**.
Place the product floating in the center of the frame with a slight, natural tilt, similar to premium ads in the **[INDUSTRY / NICHE – e.g. beverage, tech, skincare, fitness]** space.

Use clean, soft studio lighting with subtle highlights and shadows so the product looks glossy, dimensional, and premium. Keep all original label, branding, and surface details sharp and fully readable.

### STYLE
- Match the aesthetic of modern **[DTC / PREMIUM / LUXURY]** ads in the **[INDUSTRY]** space
- Simple, minimal, distraction-free composition
- Flat background with strong subject separation
- Clean edges and crisp contrast
- Subtle vignette for focus (no visible gradients)

### BACKGROUND
- Pure solid **[BACKGROUND COLOR – e.g. black (#000000), white, brand color]**
- No reflections
- No textures
- No environmental elements

### FRAMING
- **[VERTICAL / HORIZONTAL / SQUARE]** frame
- Product perfectly centered
- Generous negative space around the product
- Enough margin for later motion-tracking, cropping, or animation
- The product should feel "heroed" and dominant in the frame

### OUTPUT
- High-resolution still image
- Clean background for easy masking and compositing
- Maintain the exact shape, colors, and proportions of the user-uploaded product
- Do not stylize or alter the product itself — only enhance lighting, placement, and presentation
- The final image should look like a top-tier commercial ad frame for **[PRODUCT NAME]**

---

## 2) End Frame — Exploded View / Reveal Shot Prompt

**[PROJECT NAME] – End Frame / Reveal Shot**

Create a cinematic end-frame image that reveals the inner world of **[PRODUCT NAME]** in a visually striking way.

Render an exploded technical view of the same **[PRODUCT TYPE – e.g. espresso machine, smartwatch, sneaker, bottle, device]**, with every major component precisely separated and floating in perfect alignment, suspended in mid-air against a deep studio background.

Show the internal structure clearly and beautifully, including **[KEY INTERNAL PARTS – e.g. motor, battery, heating element, pump, circuitry, layers, materials]**, along with precision-machined components and materials that communicate craftsmanship and engineering depth.

This should feel like a luxury engineering render — hyper-real, elegant, and cinematic.

### VISUAL STYLE
- Hyper-realistic product visualization
- Ultra-sharp focus, zero motion blur
- Studio rim lighting consistent with the hero frame
- Soft highlights tracing the edges of each component
- Controlled reflections on metal, glass, plastic, or fabric surfaces
- High-contrast, cinematic lighting
- Premium, engineered, "Apple-style" industrial design aesthetic
- Clean, dramatic, and modern

### COMPOSITION
- Exploded view with perfect spacing and symmetry
- Components aligned along a clear axis
- Floating in mid-air, weightless and precise
- The assembly should read instantly as **[PRODUCT NAME]** when viewed as a whole
- No clutter, no chaos — order, clarity, and intention

### BACKGROUND
- Pure solid **[BACKGROUND COLOR – e.g. black (#000000), dark graphite, brand color]**
- No gradients
- No textures
- No environmental elements
- Designed for clean masking and compositing

### RULES
- No labels, annotations, UI, text, diagrams, or arrows
- Do not distort the product's true proportions
- Preserve realistic materials and construction logic

### OUTPUT
- Ultra-high-resolution still frame
- Photorealistic, cinematic quality
- Feels like a premium ad end-shot for **[PRODUCT NAME]**
- Should communicate: *"This product is engineered, intentional, and world-class."*

## 3) Transition Animation Prompt (Google Flow)

**[PROJECT NAME] – Transition Flow (Assembled → Exploded)**

Create a smooth, cinematic transition from the fully assembled hero product frame to the final exploded / deconstructed reveal using the uploaded product images.

Begin with **[PRODUCT NAME]** in a mid-rotation pose on a pure solid background. The product should feel suspended in space — calm, controlled, and premium.

As the rotation continues:
- Gradually introduce **[PRIMARY ELEMENTS – e.g. ingredients, layers, components, materials, particles]** entering the frame from behind and around the product
- Increase the number and density of these elements as the motion progresses
- The movement should feel intentional and engineered, not chaotic
- Build visual momentum toward a full reveal moment

Halfway through the transition, introduce a subtle **[ENERGY EFFECT – e.g. impact wave, liquid arc, air displacement, light pulse]** emerging from behind the product and partially wrapping around it, reinforcing the sense of power and transformation.

All elements must remain:
- Ultra-sharp
- Suspended in mid-air
- Free of motion blur
- Clearly readable in silhouette and detail

Throughout the transition:
- Keep the product well-lit, centered, and unobstructed
- Preserve its exact shape, colors, and proportions
- Maintain a clean, premium look at all times

The background must remain:
- Pure solid **[BACKGROUND COLOR – e.g. black (#000000)]**
- No gradients, textures, or environmental effects

End the sequence in the fully exploded / deconstructed composition, with all elements perfectly aligned and suspended in a striking final frame.

The motion should feel: smooth, deliberate, high-end, and cinematic.
The result should feel like a world-class product reveal — from hero to inner truth in one continuous, elegant movement.

## 4) AntiGravity — Scrollytelling Website Code Prompt

### ✅ ACT AS
A world-class Creative Developer (Awwwards-level) specializing in:
- Next.js
- Framer Motion
- Scroll-linked canvas animations

---

### 🎯 THE TASK
Build a premium **scrollytelling landing page** for **[PRODUCT / EXPERIENCE / BRAND]**.

**Core mechanic:** A scroll-linked animation that plays an **image sequence** of **[OBJECT / PRODUCT / SCENE]** *transforming / assembling / exploding / evolving* as the user scrolls.

**Example uses:**
- A supercar assembling itself
- A sneaker breaking into layers
- A watch revealing its internals
- A spacecraft deploying
- A SaaS product visual metaphor

---

### 🧰 TECH STACK
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas (120-frame image sequence)

---

### 🎨 VISUAL DIRECTION & COLOR
- **Seamless Blending (Non-negotiable):** The page background MUST match the image sequence background exactly: `#050505` → image edges should be invisible so **[OBJECT]** floats in a pure void.
- **Color Palette:**
  - Background: `#050505`
  - Headings: `text-white/90`
  - Body: `text-white/60`
- **Typography:** Inter or SF Pro — ultra-clean, tracking-tight, luxury minimalist aesthetic.

---

### 🧩 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

#### 1) Sticky Canvas Container
- Create: `components/[ComponentName].tsx`
- Wrapper div:
  - `height: 400vh` (4× viewport height for scroll duration)
  - Inside wrapper: `<canvas>` must be `sticky`, `top-0`, `h-screen`, `w-full`
- Canvas must be perfectly centered and responsively scaled

#### 2) Scroll-Linked Image Sequence
- Load **[FRAME_COUNT] images** from: `/public/sequence/`
- Naming convention: `frame_0.webp` → `frame_[N].webp`

**Scroll logic:**
- Use Framer Motion `useScroll` to track scroll progress `0.0 → 1.0`
- Use `useSpring` to smooth interpolation (avoid jitter)
- Map scroll progress to frame index: `Math.floor(scrollProgress * FRAME_COUNT)`

**Canvas draw:**
- Draw current frame using `drawImage()`
- Scale correctly to fit viewport (mobile + desktop)

**Preloading:**
- Preload all images
- Show a loading UI with progress bar **before** revealing the experience

#### 3) Text Overlays (Scrollytelling Beats)
Replace each block with your own story.

**Beat A — 0–20% Scroll**
- Title: **[HERO WORD / PHRASE]** (Centered, huge)
- Subtitle: [Short emotional promise]

**Beat B — 25–45% Scroll**
- Title: **[FEATURE / IDEA 1]** (Left aligned)
- Subtitle: [Supporting detail]
- Visual note: *[Describe visual change]*

**Beat C — 50–70% Scroll**
- Title: **[FEATURE / IDEA 2]** (Right aligned)
- Subtitle: [Supporting detail]
- Visual note: *[Describe visual state]*

**Beat D — 75–95% Scroll**
- Title: **[CALL TO ACTION]** (Centered CTA)
- Subtitle: [Closing line]
- Visual note: *[Final visual formation]*

All text uses `useTransform` for opacity and position.

---

### ✨ POLISH & PERFORMANCE
- Elegant loading state: animated spinner + progress bar
- "Scroll to Explore" indicator: visible at 0%, fades out by 10%
- Mobile scaling: use "contain" fit logic
- Use `useSpring` for buttery smoothness: `stiffness: 100`, `damping: 30`
- Cleanup: remove event listeners on unmount, dispose of canvas context safely
- Custom scrollbar styling: minimal, dark, subtle hover effect

---

### ⏱ ANIMATION TIMING RULES
Text overlays should:
- Fade in over the first **10%** of their range
- Stay visible through the middle
- Fade out over the last **10%**

Opacity mapping: `[start, start + 0.1, end - 0.1, end] → [0, 1, 1, 0]`

Add subtle vertical motion:
- Enter: `y: 20px → 0`
- Exit: `0 → -20px`

---

### 📦 OUTPUT — Generate Production-Ready Code
1. `app/page.tsx` — main page component
2. `components/[ComponentName].tsx` — scroll canvas animation
3. `app/globals.css` — Tailwind base styles + custom scrollbar

---

### ✅ KEY REQUIREMENTS
- TypeScript throughout
- Proper cleanup (canvas + listeners)
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- 60fps smooth animation
- Loading state before animation begins
- No flicker / no stutter during scroll
- Seamless blend with `#050505` background

---

### 🧠 STYLE NOTES
- High-end product aesthetic (Apple / automotive / luxury tech)
- Huge typography: titles `text-7xl` → `text-9xl`
- Generous whitespace
- Subtle animations only
- Professional, confident, premium feel
